## 2026-09-27 — Project started: add, subtract, multiply

Matthew's brief: an arbitrary-precision data type in C#, with addition,
subtraction and multiplication done "using binary operations"; division next.

Built `Adpdt.ApInt` (sign + magnitude, `uint[]` limbs, little-endian):

- **Add** — `BitMath.FullAdd`, a word-wide ripple adder from XOR/AND/shift
  only; the carry out of bit 31 is caught as it shifts off the top.
- **Subtract** — two's complement, `a + ~b + 1`, reusing the adder.
- **Multiply** — shift-and-add over the multiplier's set bits; only 32 shifted
  copies of the multiplicand are ever needed (bit offset 0..31, plus a whole-limb
  offset), built lazily.
- **Shifts, comparison, equality, long/ulong conversions, ++/--.**
- **Text** — decimal output by double dabble (no division needed, which matters
  since there's no divide yet), packed 8 BCD digits per `uint` with a SWAR add-3;
  decimal input by `acc*10 + d` with `*10` as `(acc<<3)+(acc<<1)`; hex and binary
  both ways; `_` digit separators.

Tests: 50, all green, `BigInteger` as oracle. Mutation check: dropping the carry
out of `FullAdd` fails 21 of them.

Rough speed (Release, operands ~all ones = worst case for shift-and-add):
100,000-bit add 0.14 ms, multiply ~0.75 s, decimal ToString of the 200k-bit
product ~0.9 s.

Not a git repo yet — flagged to Matthew.

## 2026-09-27 — Renamed BitMath to Magnitude

The class is named for what it operates on (the magnitude half of sign + magnitude)
rather than how. File is now `src/Adpdt/Magnitude.cs`; no behaviour change.

## 2026-09-27 — Division; float design agreed

Initial commit `34eef95` after Matthew's `git init` (no remote yet).

**Division**: `ApInt.DivRem` (tuple), `/`, `%`, truncating like C# — quotient sign
is the XOR of the signs, remainder takes the dividend's. `Magnitude.DivRem` is
restoring binary long division: shift the dividend's bits into a running
remainder one at a time, subtract the divisor (a + ~b + 1 again) whenever it
fits, write a 1 in that quotient place. The remainder lives in one array of
divisor-length + 1 and is worked on in place. Divide by zero throws
`DivideByZeroException`; `long.MinValue / -1` is just 2^63 here.

Tests 50 → 59, checked against C#'s own `long` `/` and `%` as well as
`BigInteger`, plus: repeated `% 10` agrees with double dabble (two independent
routes to the decimal digits). Mutation check: `>= 0` → `> 0` in the "does it
fit" comparison fails 7. Speed: 200,000-bit / 100,000-bit in ~0.3 s.

**Floating point design** (discussed with Matthew, his choice): arbitrary precision
but IEEE-style and byte-aligned. Matthew proposed "max / 2" as an exponent bias —
which is exactly IEEE 754's bias (`max >> 1` = `0111…1`: 127, 1023, 16383). Plan:
MPFR-style `ApFloat` in memory (signed `long` exponent, no bias needed), correctly
rounded like IEEE, and IEEE `binary{k}` as the byte format, where the bias lives;
k any multiple of 32 from 128 via the IEEE 754-2008 width formula. Details in TODO.

## 2026-09-30 — Project renamed Adpdt → Natural

Matthew named the GitHub repo `MatthewCarven/Natural`, so the code follows:
namespace `Natural`, `Natural.slnx`, `src/Natural/Natural.csproj`,
`tests/Natural.Tests/`. All moves via `git mv`. The internal limb-arithmetic class
stays `Magnitude` — the rename to `Natural` considered on 2026-09-28 was only to
dodge a `Magnitude` namespace, which didn't happen. The folder on disk is still
`ADPDT` (Matthew's call). `origin` moved from `Magnitude.git` to `Natural.git`;
the old `Magnitude` repo is Matthew's to delete or archive.

Done two days late: on 2026-09-28 a server-side permission-check outage blocked
every shell command for the rest of the session.

## 2026-09-30 — ApFloat core (smoke-tested), and the plan for the rest

`src/Natural/ApFloat.cs`: ±m × 2^e (m odd, `long` exponent, no bias in memory),
precision per value, ±0 / ±∞ / NaN. Every operation computes the exact result with
the integer code and rounds once in `RoundExact` (four IEEE modes; a sticky bit for
division's remainder; a `minExp` floor for the subnormals to come). `+ − × ÷` with
IEEE's special cases; `Add` swaps an operand far below the rounding point for a
single sticky bit, so 1 + 2^-1000000 costs nothing. Hex-float `ToString`. Small
additions: `Magnitude.TestBit` / `AnyBitsBelow` / `TrailingZeroCount`, and
`ApInt.Limbs` / `FromLimbs` (internal).

Smoke check, not tests: 12/12 against known `%a` strings (1/3, 1/10, 0.1 + 0.2 =
0x1.3333333333334p-2, signed zeros, 1/0, 0/0, the gap shortcut both ways). The one
"failure" was my expected value: 1/3 at 200 bits ends ...56p-2, not ...58p-2, as
Python's `fractions` confirmed independently.

Matthew asked to stop at a plan this session; the rest is in TODO as three sessions
(prove the core + Half/float/double; `binary{k}`; decimal text) and three open questions.

**Decided, same day**: decimal text is designed for eyeballing. Matthew reads a column
of numbers like a bar graph (zeros kept, so widths and points line up, as in Chess
Bruteforcer's fixed-width output). Default `ToString()` will print the digits the
precision carries, zeros kept (17 for 53 bits, 62 for 200); aligned `F`/`E`/custom-`0`
formats and a binary-point view come too. All three are in TODO session 3.
